    title: "Chez Amis",
    story: `Born in Lyon, France, and trained in some of Europe's most prestigious kitchens, Chef Antoine Dubois found his true calling in Accra. After years of traveling and exploring global cuisines, he fell in love with Ghana's vibrant food culture and warm hospitality.

What started as a dream to blend French culinary techniques with West African flavors has become Chez Amis—a place where every dish tells a story, and every guest feels like family.

"Food is more than sustenance," Chef Antoine believes. "It's a bridge between cultures, a celebration of life, and an expression of love. At Chez Amis, we don't just serve meals—we create memories."`,
    philosophy: `Our philosophy is simple yet profound: source the finest ingredients, honor traditional techniques, and infuse every dish with genuine care. We believe in the power of food to bring people together, to celebrate moments both big and small, and to nourish not just the body, but the soul.`,
